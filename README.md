# Kotlin_Rx_TMDB_GooglePagingLibrary
Kotlin, Google Paging Library, RxJava
Created a project to help display list of movies.
Used "The Movie Database" website you achieve this.
You can go to https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US and create your own profile to get the secret key.
This key we'll be needing while calling the TMDB API.
Used the Google Paging Library to fetch the real-time data in pages
Used ConstraintLayout
